Title – SAIL: A Scalable AI Lifecycle Framework for Coordinated AI Adoption in Software Organizations 
Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to develop and evaluate SAIL, a structured framework that enables software 
organizations to adopt AI in a coordinated, scalable, and reusable manner. The expected outcome is a plug-and
play AI adoption model with clear guidelines for use case mapping, staged implementation (Awareness → Pilot 
→ Scale → AI-Native), governance, and cross-team reuse—providing practical value for CTOs, engineering leads, 
and innovation managers. 
Research gap – While literature addresses enterprise architecture (Bernard, 2012), Digital Transformation (Warner 
& Wäger, 2019), innovation diffusion (Rogers, 2003), dynamic capabilities (Teece, 2007), and resource-based 
view (Barney, 1991), there is no integrated, use-case-driven framework designed specifically for scalable AI 
adoption across software teams. Existing models focus on isolated AI pilots or generic transformation strategies, 
lacking mechanisms for coordination, reuse, and progressive scaling. This study fills that gap by proposing and 
conceptually validating SAIL as a practical, theory-informed framework tailored for software organizations. 
Research question – How should AI adoption in software organizations be structured to ensure scalability, 
coordination, and reusability across diverse use cases? 
Theoretical lens – The study is grounded in five key theoretical foundations: (1) Enterprise Architecture (EA) 
(Bernard, 2012) for systemic integration; (2) Digital Transformation (Matt et al., 2015) for organizational 
readiness; (3) Innovation Diffusion Theory (Rogers, 2003) to understand adoption dynamics; (4) Dynamic 
Capabilities (Teece, 2007) for strategic agility in sensing, seizing, and transforming AI opportunities; and (5) 
Resource-Based View (RBV) (Barney, 1991) to treat AI assets (models, data, knowledge) as valuable, rare, and 
hard-to-imitate resources. These lenses collectively inform SAIL’s design and evaluation. 
Design/methodology/approach –  This research follows a conceptual, theory-driven methodology using design
based research (Hevner et al., 2004). The approach includes: (1) a comprehensive literature review synthesizing 
theories on AI adoption and organizational change; (2) framework development defining SAIL’s pillars (use case 
identification, adoption staging, governance, implementation roles, evaluation & reuse); and (3) conceptual 
evaluation through theoretical application to realistic AI use cases (e.g., code generation, documentation 
automation, sprint planning). For each use case, I will outline step-by-step how SAIL guides: identification → 
prioritization → pilot design → scaling path → governance → reuse. This demonstrates SAIL’s internal coherence, 
scalability, and practical utility without primary data collection. 
Time plan – Submit proposal: End of this week 
• Finish literature review and start empirical part: By the end of September 
• Submit your master thesis: By the End of the year 
Expected challenges & limitations – As a conceptual study, the main limitation is the absence of real-world 
validation. However, the use case walkthroughs are designed to simulate realistic organizational contexts, 
enhancing practical plausibility. A key challenge is ensuring the framework remains both theoretically rigorous 
and accessible to practitioners, which will be addressed through iterative refinement and alignment with industry
relevant examples.

# 2. Literature Review

In order to ground the SAIL framework in established theory, this chapter will focus on the current state of research across five key theoretical lenses relevant to AI adoption in software organizations. The concept of AI adoption is multifaceted, involving technological, organizational, and strategic dimensions. The main challange is the lack of an integrated framework which is addressing the concept of "Full Lifecycle" adoption of AI in a coordinated and scalable manner. The aspect of AI being a very new technology, hinders the existence of established frameworks and supportive literature. Therefore, this chapter will rather review individual theories and models that are going to be synthesized later throughou the theoretical framework chapter.

## 2.1 Enterprise Architecture and AI Integration [REF]  
- EA as systemic integration mechanism.  
- EA’s role in aligning IT with strategy.  
- Potential for supporting AI alignment and scaling.  

In order to ground the SAIL framework in established theory the focus on Enterprise Architecture (EA) is crucial. Enterprise Architecture is providing a holistic approach to the problem of aligning IT with business strategy and goals. The principle of EA and its utilization in organizations is well documented in literature [REF]. However the not so well pointed out aspect is the type of company to which EA is applied. Different types of companies have different needs and requirements and technological readiness. Software organizations are typically more agile and introduction of major changes is easier to implement and does not create a lot of resistance. In contrast to this, traditional industries such as manufacturing or banking are more rigid and changes are harder to implement, thus EA frameworks in these industries are more rigid and bureaucratic.

EA does not work as a silver bullet and it is not solving all problems by itself. There are several frameworks and methodologies which are used in practice. The most well known and implemented in companies are the frameworks are The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF) and Zachman Framework. The mentioned frameworks are the current state of the art in EA and are widely used in practice. Each of the frameworks has its strengths and weaknesses and the choice of the framework depends on the context of the organization.
TOGAF being more dominant in the cases where the organization is more agile and dynamic, while Zachman Framework is more suitable for traditional and rigid organizations.

In the current Digital Transformation era, TOGAF is more suitable as more and more organizations are becoming agile and dynamic and the usage of AI can be implemented in a way that is more aligned with TOGAF principles while still keeping the structure and rigor of EA. The usage and value extraction of AI in organizations is not a trivial task and it requires a structured approach. EA can provide the necessary structure and rigor to ensure that AI initiatives are aligned with business strategy and goals.


EA is therefore crucial for AI integration and scaling :

- It alligns AI initiatives with business strategy, ensuring that isolated pilots are connected to broader organizational goals and prevents existance of "siloed" AI projects.

- It provides a systemic view of the organization while having established governance mechanisms, which is crucial for managing the complexity of AI adoption across multiple teams and departments.

- It facilitates reuse of AI assets (models, data, knowledge) across teams by establishing common standards and repositories, thus preventing duplication of efforts and promoting efficiency.


On contrast the framework of Zachman is more rigid and bureaucratic and it is not so suitable for the dynamic nature of AI adoption. The Zachman points out that the architecture is a schema for organizing architectural artifacts (for example, design documents, specifications, and models) that takes into account both who the artifact targets (for example, business owner and builder) and what particular issue (for example, data and functionality) is being addressed. The Zachman framework is more suitable for traditional and rigid organizations where changes are harder to implement. The usage of AI in such organizations is more challenging as the adoption of AI requires a more agile and dynamic approach.

Both of the frameworks have their strengths and weaknesses and the choice of the framework depends on the context of the organization. However, for the purpose of this thesis, TOGAF is more suitable as it is more aligned with the principles of Digital Transformation and AI adoption.
Both of them were developed in the times of "pre-AI" era and therefore do not address the specific challenges and requirements of AI adoption. However, the principles and concepts of EA can be adapted and extended to address the specific needs of AI adoption in software organizations.
The SAIL framework will therefore build upon the principles of EA and adapt them to the specific context of AI adoption in software organizations.


## 2.2 Digital Transformation and Organizational Readiness [REF]  
- Definition and scope of Digital Transformation.  
- Barriers to readiness (skills, culture, infrastructure).  
- Stages of transformation maturity.  
- Lessons for AI adoption.

The concept of Digital Transformation is closely related to the adoption of AI in organizations. Digital Transformation refers to the integration of digital technologies into all areas of a business, fundamentally changing how the organization operates and delivers value to customers. Year by year, more and more organizations are undergoing Digital Transformation in order to stay competitive in the market and the prevalence of AI is only amplifying this successful digital revolution. The proof of the fact that Digital Transformation is in fact a successful concept can be seen by comparing the amount of companies which have undergone Digital Transformation in the last decade and the revenue growth of these companies. The companies which have undergone Digital Transformation have seen a significant increase in revenue and market share, while the companies which have not undergone Digital Transformation have seen a decline in revenue and market share [REF]. 


The success of Digital Transformation can be observed in the performance of companies that have succesfully embraced it compared to those that have not. Firms that have implemented Digital Transformation strategies report significantly stronger revenue growth and improved market share. Companies that are more digitally mature are up to 2.5 times more likely to see double-digit revenue growth than their less mature peers [REF]. Deloitte also says that digitally mature companies see an average revenue growth of about 45%, while less mature companies only see about 15% growth [REF]. BCG further highlights that successful transformations yield 15–25% increases in revenue and substantial efficiency gains [REF].

These results show that Digital Transformation is not just a theory; it is a real way to gain a competitive edge. As AI technologies become more and more a part of Digital Transformation, they are expected to help businesses make more money, run more smoothly, and stay strong over time.

Proof of Digital Transformation success:

- McKinsey (2021, 2023 updates): Companies that successfully undergo digital transformation are 2.5x more likely to report double-digit revenue growth compared to peers that lag behind in digital adoption【source: McKinsey Digital】.

- Deloitte (2023): Digitally mature companies achieve ~45% revenue growth on average , compared to ~15% growth for less mature companies【source: Deloitte Insights】.

- BCG (2020–2023 studies): Only about 30% of digital transformations succeed, but those that do deliver 15–25% increases in revenue and 30%+ improvement in operational efficiency【source: BCG Digital Acceleration Index】.

- Harvard Business Review (2022): Companies that invested heavily in AI and digital transformation were 5x more likely to gain market share than laggards【source: HBR – “Driving Digital Transformation with AI”】.


Regarding AI adoption, Digital Transformation provides several lessons:
- Organizational readiness is crucial. Successful Digital Transformation requires not just technology but also changes in culture, skills, and processes. Similarly, AI adoption needs organizational readiness to manage change effectively.
- Maturity models can guide progression. Digital Transformation maturity models outline stages from initial experimentation to full integration. AI adoption can benefit from similar staged approaches to manage complexity and scale effectively.

The implementation of AI in organizations very much depends on the readiness of the organization to embrace change. This change comes in different forms, such as changes in culture, skills, and processes but also in the current technological infrastructure of the company and its ability to integrate new technologies. Challanges such as lack of permissions, lack of skills, lack of understanding of the technology and its potential, lack of resources and budget are all common barriers to the adoption of AI in organizations. These barriers can be overcome by following a structured approach to AI adoption, which is the main purpose of the SAIL framework. This would allow companies to overcome the barriers and successfully implement AI in their organizations and show them the standardized way of doing so and thus increase the chances of success while outlining which fields of the organization need to be changed in order to successfully implement AI.


The broad term of organizational readiness can be measured through different maturity models. The most well known and widely used maturity model is the Digital Maturity Model (DMM) developed by Deloitte. The DMM outlines five stages of digital maturity:
1. Initial: Ad hoc and uncoordinated digital initiatives.
2. Developing: Some digital initiatives, but still siloed and uncoordinated.
3. Defined: Digital initiatives are defined and coordinated across the organization.
4. Managed: Digital initiatives are managed and measured for impact.
5. Optimized: Digital is fully integrated into business strategy and operations.

In order to successfully implement AI in organizations, the assumption of high level of digital maturity is crucial. The higher the level of digital maturity, the higher the chances of success in implementing AI in organizations. The SAIL framework will therefore build upon the principles of Digital Transformation and adapt them to the specific context of AI adoption in software organizations.





## 2.3 Innovation Diffusion Theory [REF]  
- Rogers’ model: innovators, early adopters, majority, laggards.  
- Adoption curve dynamics.  
- Relevance to AI technologies in software organizations.  
- How diffusion insights guide scaling strategies.  

Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT), developed by Everett Rogers, provides a valuable lens for understanding how new technologies, such as AI, are adopted within organizations. This theory is particularly relevant in the context of AI adoption in software organizations, where the pace of rapid industry change and technological advancement creates both opportunities and challenges for adoption.

IDT become relevant in the context of technology adoption in organizations. The theory outlines how innovations are communicated over time among the members of a social system. The key elements of IDT include the innovation itself, communication channels, time, and the social system. The rise of usage of IDT is closely related to the rise of technology adoption in organizations and the recognition that successful adoption of new technologies requires more than just the technology itself; it also requires effective communication and social dynamics within the organization.

Perfect example where IDT was successfully applied is in the Israeli tech sector, where early adopters in startups and tech companies drove the initial adoption of AI technologies, leading to broader acceptance across the industry. This diffusion was facilitated by strong networks and knowledge sharing among innovators and early adopters, which helped to build trust and demonstrate the value of AI. Thus creating a country which swiftly became the "Startup Nation" and a global leader in AI innovation while having an insignificant population of only 9 million people and the amount of AI startups per capita being the country with the highest number worldwide【source: Startup Genome Report 2023】. 

The key components of IDT include:
- Innovation: The acceptance of AI technologies as a new innovation within the organization.
- Communication Channels: The methods through which information about AI is shared within the organization (e.g., meetings, workshops, internal communications).
- Time: The duration over which AI adoption occurs, including the stages of adoption.
- Social System: The organizational culture and structure that influence how AI is perceived and adopted.

These key components were laid out in Rogers' seminal work "Diffusion of Innovations" (2003) more than two decades ago, but they remain highly relevant in today's context of rapid technological change and AI adoption. The ability to understand and leverage these components is crucial for successful AI adoption in software organizations. Each of these components plays a critical role in shaping the adoption process and determining the success of AI initiatives. 
By following the principles of IDT, organizations are able to effectively manage the adoption process, address resistance, and build momentum for AI initiatives, while still being aware of the risks and challenges associated with AI adoption. The SAIL framework will therefore incorporate insights from IDT to guide the scaling strategies for AI adoption in software organizations.
The effective usage of IDT in organisations can be implemented through the following steps:



1. Start with innovators and early adopters: Identify and engage individuals or teams within the organization who show a strong interest in AI and are willing to experiment with new technologies. This will naturally create champions for AI adoption. The most important aspect is to identify the right people who are willing to experiment and take risks and give the people the freedom to do so. This will create a culture of innovation and experimentation within the organization.
2. Leverage communication channels: The usage of effective communication channels is crucial for spreading awareness. The spark that was created by the innovators and early adopters needs to be spread across the organization and let the fire of innovation spread. The most effective ways to do so are through company wide presentantions, demos, workshops and upper management support. The communication needs to be clear and concise and the benefits of AI adoption need to be highlighted. 


3. Address concerns and resistance: It is natural for people to be resistant to change, the natural human behavior is to resist change and stick to the status quo. Therefore the emphasize on addressing concerns and resistance is crucial. This is done by creating a level of trust and transparency. The concerns of employees need to be addressed and the benefits of AI adoption need to be highlighted. For the successful adoption of AI the value proposition needs to be clear and the benefits need to outweigh the risks.

4. Build a supportive social system: Organizational culture and structure play a crucial role in shaping how AI is perceived and adopted. This means that the culture of the organization needs to be supportive of innovation and experimentation. By fostering a culture that is exploratory and innovation driven we can create an environment where AI adoption can thrive. The kernel of the culture needs to allign with the long term mission and vision of the organization which at the end needs to be AI-Native.


By following the principles of IDT, organizations have a clear way to manage the adoption process, address resistance, and create a momentum where AI is embraced and incorporated into the culture which the SAIL framework will build upon.
