# SAIL – A Scalable AI Lifecycle Framework for Coordinated AI Adoption in Software Organizations

## Overview
This repository contains the materials for a Master’s thesis focused on developing and evaluating SAIL, a structured framework designed to enable software organizations to adopt Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a coordinated, scalable, and reusable manner.

## Purpose
The thesis aims to address the lack of integrated, use-case-driven frameworks for scalable AI adoption across software teams. SAIL provides practical guidelines for use case mapping, staged implementation (Awareness → Pilot → Scale → AI-Native), governance, and cross-team reuse.

## Structure
- **thesis.md**: Main thesis document, including abstract, chapters, references, and appendices.
- **proposal.md**: Research proposal and outline.
- **.copilot.md**: Writing guidelines and instructions for thesis development.

## Key Concepts
- **Research Question**: How should AI adoption in software organizations be structured to ensure scalability, coordination, and reusability across diverse use cases?
- **Theoretical Lenses**: Enterprise Architecture, Digital Transformation, Innovation Diffusion, Dynamic Capabilities, Resource-Based View.
- **Methodology**: Design Science Research with conceptual framework development and use case walkthroughs.

## How to Use
- Review `thesis.md` for the full thesis draft and structure.
- Refer to `proposal.md` for the research outline and objectives.
- Consult `.copilot.md` for writing standards and requirements.
