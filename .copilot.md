## Goal
Assist in writing a **20,000-word Master’s thesis** in business/management/engineering.  
Topic: *SAIL – A Scalable AI Lifecycle Framework for Coordinated AI Adoption in Software Organizations*.  
Output must be formal, academic, and logically structured.

## Writing Style
- Academic English, clear and concise.  
- Formal tone, objective perspective.  
- No casual phrases, no first-person writing.  
- Use transitions to connect sections smoothly.  

## Structure
- Use Markdown headings: `# Chapter`, `## Section`, `### Subsection`.  
- Start each section with an **introductory paragraph** and end with a **summary/transition**.  
- For citations, insert `[REF]` as a placeholder.  

## Focus Areas
- Research question: *How should AI adoption in software organizations be structured to ensure scalability, coordination, and reusability across diverse use cases?*  
- Theoretical lenses: Enterprise Architecture, Digital Transformation, Innovation Diffusion, Dynamic Capabilities, Resource-Based View.  
- Methodology: Design Science Research with conceptual framework development and use case walkthroughs.  

## Output Preferences
- Write in **manageable sections** (300–500 words).  
- Use **bullet points, tables, or numbered steps** only when they clarify complex concepts.  
- Connect arguments to **software organizations, AI adoption, lifecycle frameworks**.  
- Highlight **practical implications** for CTOs, engineering leads, and innovation managers.  
- Do not invent sources; always use `[REF]`.  

## Don’ts
- Don’t explain basic concepts to the reader (assume advanced knowledge).  
- Don’t generate giant walls of text — keep paragraphs focused.  
- Don’t repeat content unless it strengthens an argument.  

## Local files
- proposal.md should serve as the main outline and reference document.
- When writing always stick to what was promised in the proposal.
- Stay close the proposal and the idea of SAIL. 
- If you need to invent something, invent it in a way that is consistent with the proposal.
